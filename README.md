# Quantum Consciousness Alignment Simulator

This simulator models a simplified quantum branching system based on the QCA theoretical framework. It simulates attention weight evolution, decoherence control, and affinity metrics over time.

## Files
- `qca_simulator.py`: Core simulator class.
- `run_simulation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook to run and visualize results.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies.

## Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook run_simulation.ipynb
```
